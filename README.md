# poc
The following list of features is required to compile a POC language:

Lexer (Lexical Analyzer):
Word analysis algorithm
Special word keys and symbols definition
Code block parsing
Comment and string parsing

Parser:
Grammar rules
AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) structure
Syntax checking and debugging

Semantic Analyser:
Typing and type checking
Context checking
Debugging and warnings

Intermediate Representation (IR) Generator:
Translating AST to IR code
Storing necessary information for optimization

Optimizer:
Code movement
Redundancy elimination
Constant expression evaluation
Evaluation optimization

Code Emitter:
Translating IR code to machine code
Register allocation
Memory management
Control flow optimization

Memory Manager:
Memory allocation and deallocation
Garbage collection (optional)

Runtime Environment:
Standard library modules
System calls
Error handling

Debugging Support:
Error messages and location information
Debugging mode

Performance Profiling:
Time and memory profile
Optimization suggestions

These components will form the basic structure required to compile the Poc language.
Each component is written in C++ and customized to the specific features of the POC language.
